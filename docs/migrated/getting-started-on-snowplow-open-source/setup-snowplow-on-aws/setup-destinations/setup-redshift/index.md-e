[Amazon Redshift](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/) is a highly scalable analytical warehouse, working in AWS cloud. Snowplow pipeline provides loading data into Redshift with [RDB Shredder](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/open-source-components-and-applications/snowplow-rdb-loader/rdb-shredder/) and [RDB Loader](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/open-source-components-and-applications/snowplow-rdb-loader/rdb-loader/) apps.

Before 2021, a primary way to load data into Redshift was using EmrEtlRunner orchestration tool. After [RDB Loader R35 release](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/pipeline-components-and-applications/loaders-storage-targets/snowplow-rdb-loader/r35-upgrade-guide/#new-configuration-file) we're deprecating EmrEtlRunner and recommend to use stand-alone Loader setup.

In order to load data into Redshift, you need to setup an [S3 sink for enriched data](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/getting-started-on-snowplow-open-source/setup-snowplow-on-aws/setup-destinations/load-data-to-s3/) first.
