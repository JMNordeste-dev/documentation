[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/) is a fully-managed cloud data warehouse with rich support of semi-structured data and tight integration with AWS. Snowplow allows to load data into Snowflake with [Snowplow Snowflake Loader](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/open-source-components-and-applications/snowplow-snowflake-loader/).

Before setting up Snowflake Loader it is recommeded to [get access to Snowflake](https://trial.snowflake.com/) database first. Setup is [a trivial command](https://docs.snowplowanalytics.com/docs/open-source-components-and-applications/snowplow-snowflake-loader/setup/) in Snowflake Loader.
