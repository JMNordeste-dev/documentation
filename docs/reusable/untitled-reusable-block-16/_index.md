| This enrichment is deprecated |
| --- |

The library powering this enrichment has now been declared as end of life and won’t receive any updates: [www.bitwalker.eu/software/user-agent-utils](http://www.bitwalker.eu/software/user-agent-utils). Because this could one day result in a potential security issue (due to lack of maintenance), we encourage everyone to move away from this enrichment in favor of [the ua parser enrichment](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/ua-parser-enrichment). However, please keep in mind that this is not a drop-in replacement: the ua parser enrichment will fill an external `com_snowplowanalytics_snowplow_ua_parser_context_1` table (you can find the Iglu schema [here](https://github.com/snowplow/iglu-central/blob/master/schemas/com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow/ua_parser_context/jsonschema/1-0-0)) instead of a few fields in `atomic.events`. In the future, we will move the fields affected by the user agent utils enrichments out of `atomic.events` into their own context and, as a follow up, remove it entirely.

### Compatibility

JSON Schema [iglu:com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow/user\_agent\_utils\_config/jsonschema/1-0-0](http://iglucentral.com/schemas/com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow/user_agent_utils_config/jsonschema/1-0-0) Compatibility r63+ Data provider [user-agent-utils](https://github.com/HaraldWalker/user-agent-utils)

### Overview

This enrichment uses the [user-agent-utils](https://github.com/HaraldWalker/user-agent-utils) library to parse the useragent into the following fields: `br_name``br_family``br_version``br_type``br_renderengine``os_name``os_family``os_manufacturer``dvce_type``dvce_ismobile`

### Example

This enrichment has no special configuration: it is either off or on. Enable it with the following JSON:

{
    "schema": "iglu:com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow/user\_agent\_utils\_config/jsonschema/1-0-0",
    "data": {
        "vendor": "com.snowplowanalytics.snowplow",
        "name": "user\_agent\_utils\_config",
        "enabled": true,
        "parameters": {}
  }
}

_**Note**_: As an alternative solution, you could enable [`ua-parser` enrichment](https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow/wiki/ua-parser-enrichment) either in place of this enrichment or as an accopmanying enhancement. There’s no conflict here as the output data of these enrichments will end up in different tables.

### Data sources

The input value for the enrichment comes from `ua` parameter which is mapped to `useragent` field in `atomic.events` table.

### Algorithm

This enrichment uses 3rd party [`user-agent-utils`](https://github.com/HaraldWalker/user-agent-utils) library to parse the useragent string.

### Data generated

Below is the summary of the fields in `atomic.events` table driven by the result of this enrichment (no dedicated table).

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `br_name` | Browser name |
| `br_family` | Browser family |
| `br_version` | Browser version |
| `br_type` | Browser type |
| `br_renderengine` | Rendering engine of the browserw |
| `os_name` | Operationg sytem name |
| `os_family` | Operationg sytem family |
| `os_manufacturer` | Manufacturers of operating system |
| `dvce_type` | Device type |
| `dvce_ismobile` | Indicates whether divice is moblile |
