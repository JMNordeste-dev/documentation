Snowplow Trackers are client- or server-side libraries which enable you to collect events from your own applications.

View our [webhooks for tracking events from third-party applications](/docs/collecting-data/collecting-data-from-third-parties/index.md).

```mdx-code-block
import SnowplowDocCardList from '@site/src/components/SnowplowDocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<SnowplowDocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
