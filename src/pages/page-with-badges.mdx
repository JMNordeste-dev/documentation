import Badges from '@site/src/components/Badges';

# Page with Badges on it

Uses common template and passes a `badgeType` to determine which badge to display.
Not sure how many badges there are, so the Badges component may grow in size.
If component breaks then its normally because its being called with a value it
doesn't recognise.  Needs to be more resilient.
